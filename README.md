# Python-Tools

Here is a repo for tools I am building to do simple calculations or automate tasks.

StressTransformationAnalyzer.py: Script that takes in three vaules: SigmaX, SigmaY, & Tau and outputs a graph of the stress transformation from 0 to 360 degrees as well as prints out the principal stresses.

FileNameChanger: Script that can change the file name for a bunch of files uniformly (i.e. add or remove 'test' to the end of a file)
